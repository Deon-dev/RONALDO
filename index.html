    <h4><span style="background-color: bisque;">Real Madrid (2009–2018)</span></h4>
    <p>In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record <mark style="background-color: rgb(255, 132, 132);">£80 million</mark>. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.</p>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer on 12 September 2015 against Espanyol, netting 230 goals in 203 matches, surpassing the previous record holder, Raúl. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of <del>450</del> no 500 career goals for club and country. He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.</p>

    <h4><span style="background-color: bisque;">Goal celebrations</span></h4>
    <p>Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.<sup>[296][297][298]</sup> After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion" into his "signature power stance", while usually simultaneously exclaiming "Sí" (Spanish and Italian for "yes"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Siu" or siuuu in the media.<sub>[296][297][300]</sub> It has also been known as "suiii", "siiuuu", "siii" or "Right Here Right Now", formally the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration. Since Ronaldo first performed the gesture in 2013, it has been widely imitated by athletes and personalities both in and outside of football when celebrating scoring in respective sports or a significant achievement, and is widely regarded as the most iconic association football celebration of all time</p>
    <p>The gesture was first performed by Ronaldo on 7 August, during the 2013 International Champions Cup Final between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Ronaldo gave Madrid a 2–1 lead with a free kick when he headed in a cross from Isco, helping Madrid beat Chelsea 3–1 to claim the International Champions Cup and celebrating with his first "Siuuu". During an interview after the match against Chelsea when he first performed the gesture, Ronaldo explained he scored the goal and "it just felt natural" and "didn't know where it came from". He started doing it more often and when the supporters see it they are reminded of him.</p>
    <p>The phrase "siu" is derived from Portuguese sim, meaning "yes". This was confirmed by Ronaldo in an interview in 2023, almost a decade since he first performed it. Ronaldo explained that the phrase <q>"Siuuu" simply means yes, but "meaning it very strongly".</q></p>
    <p>Ronaldo once said ;<blockquote><i>Talent isn't Everything. You can Have it from the cradle, but it is necessary to learn the trade to be the best</i></blockquote></p>
